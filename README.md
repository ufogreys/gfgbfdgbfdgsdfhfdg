## How Many $WALY Tokens  Are There in Circulation?

WalleBytes launched on polygon mainnet on January 6, 2022, with 27 billion $WALY tokens created at genesis. ~97% of token supply transferred to the smart contract and under its control. ~3% resides in an operator wallet controlled by the development team. ⅓ will be used for airdrops and adding to the current $WALY/MATIC token pair. ⅓ will be staked within the smart contract for 5 years and the remaining balance will be burned upon completion. During allotted burning periods users are encouraged to burn their holdings and are rewarded for depleting the token supply. All addresses that participated in the burn period are granted seven-day access to an exclusive minting portal for Wallet Monster Apus NFTs, and three-day access to free mints for in-game Apus NFT items. After every successful burn period, the team will burn a minimum of the total amount burned by users if possible. If there are no participants the development team will burn 1% of the token supply if possible. Burning cycles will continue until contract token balance depletion.
